Open the .csproj file in Visual Studio (tested with VS Community Edition 2017 15.5.7).

Test scenarios can be found under Features. To execute them, use the Test Explorer window (under Test -> Windows)

All dependencies are bundled in the NuGet Manager. You will just need to have the Chrome browser installed.
